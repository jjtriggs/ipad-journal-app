# Technical Requirements Document

## Platform Requirements

### Target Platform
- **Primary**: iPad OS 16.0+
- **Secondary**: iPhone 15+ (future consideration)
- **Tertiary**: macOS (future consideration)

### Device Compatibility
- iPad Pro (all generations)
- iPad Air (4th generation and later)
- iPad (9th generation and later)
- iPad mini (6th generation and later)

### Apple Pencil Support
- Apple Pencil (1st generation) - basic functionality
- Apple Pencil (2nd generation) - full feature set including gestures
- Hover detection for supported devices
- Pressure and tilt sensitivity

## Performance Requirements

### Rendering Performance
- Apple Pencil latency: <20ms target, <30ms maximum
- App launch time: <2 seconds cold start
- Journal switching: <1 second
- Search results: <500ms for 1000+ entries
- Template loading: <1 second

### Memory and Storage
- RAM usage: <500MB during active use
- Local storage: Efficient compression for handwriting data
- Cloud storage: Optimized sync with delta updates
- Cache management: Auto-cleanup of old cached data

## Architecture Requirements

### Design Patterns
- MVVM architecture with SwiftUI
- Repository pattern for data access
- Dependency injection for testability
- Protocol-oriented programming
- Reactive programming with Combine

### Core Frameworks
- **PencilKit**: Apple Pencil integration and drawing
- **Core Data**: Local persistence and data modeling
- **CloudKit**: Cross-device synchronization
- **Vision**: Handwriting recognition
- **Natural Language**: Text analysis and sentiment
- **StoreKit**: In-app purchases for templates

### Data Architecture
```
Core Data Stack:
- Journal (name, created_date, template_id, cover_image)
- Entry (date, content_data, text_transcript, tags, mood)
- Template (name, layout, prompts, premium_flag)
- User (settings, preferences, subscription_status)
```

## Security and Privacy Requirements

### Data Protection
- All local data encrypted using iOS Data Protection
- Keychain storage for sensitive authentication tokens
- No personal data transmitted without explicit user consent
- Handwriting recognition processed on-device only

### Privacy Compliance
- No analytics without user opt-in
- Clear data collection disclosure
- User can delete all data permanently
- Export functionality for data portability
- COPPA compliance for any users under 13

## Integration Requirements

### Apple Services
- iCloud for data sync and backup
- Sign in with Apple for authentication
- App Store for distribution and payments
- TestFlight for beta testing

### Third-Party Services (Future)
- Optional integrations with:
  - Calendar apps for scheduling journal time
  - Health app for mood tracking correlation
  - Shortcuts app for automation

## Quality Requirements

### Reliability
- 99.9% app uptime (no crashes during normal use)
- Graceful degradation when offline
- Automatic recovery from sync conflicts
- Data integrity validation

### Scalability
- Support 1000+ journal entries per user
- Handle journals with 500+ pages
- Efficient search across large datasets
- Template store with 100+ templates

### Maintainability
- Comprehensive unit test coverage (>80%)
- UI automation tests for critical paths
- Code documentation and architectural decision records
- Continuous integration pipeline

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- iPad-only for MVP (no iPhone version initially)
- Requires Apple Pencil for full experience
- Minimum iOS 16 for latest PencilKit features
- English language only for MVP

### Business Constraints
- Must launch within 6 months
- Bootstrap budget (no external API costs initially)
- Solo developer initially
- Apple Developer Program membership required

### Assumptions
- Users have basic familiarity with iPad and Apple Pencil
- Journaling market continues to grow
- Apple Pencil adoption continues to increase
- Users willing to pay for premium journaling experience

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Usability
- First journal entry completed within 5 minutes of app launch
- No more than 3 taps to reach any core feature
- Intuitive gesture support throughout app
- Accessibility compliance (VoiceOver, Dynamic Type)

### Performance
- Memory footprint remains stable during extended use
- Battery impact similar to other drawing apps
- Network usage minimized through intelligent sync
- Storage growth managed through compression

### Security
- Biometric authentication option for app access
- Secure data transmission (TLS 1.3)
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Prompt security updates for vulnerabilities
